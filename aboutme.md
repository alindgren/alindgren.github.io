I am a Lead Software Engineer at Fundation in New York City and an Umbraco consultant.  My interests range from technology to travel. Outside of work, I am devoted to my wife and two children. I am also interested in helping people and I serve on the board of [The World Organization for Positive Action](https://www.worldpositiveaction.org/).

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
