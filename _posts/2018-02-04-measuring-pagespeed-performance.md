Pagespeed is an important factor in providing a good web user experience. A commonly quoted statistic for this is that 40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load. It is common for sites to see increased conversions after implementing performance optimizations. Pagespeed is not just a factor for user experience but also effects search. Google has stated that page speed is now a factor in their web search ranking algorithm.

There are so many factors that go into providing good pagespeed for a site, that sometimes optimizing a site seems more like art than science. Most people start with Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Insights - a tool that scores the performance of a page using several rules:

* Avoid landing page redirects
* Enable compression
* Improve server response time
* Leverage browser caching
* Minify resources
* Optimize images
* Optimize CSS Delivery
* Prioritize visible content
* Remove render-blocking JavaScript
